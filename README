<C-q> move cursor at closing bracket to make easy appending variables 
      rotate all bracket pairs in hierarchial order. 
<C-b> in opposite order with <C-q> 

<A-q> same order with <C-q> but cursor located at front pos of bracket pair 
<A-b> same order with <C-b> 


<C-j> move through quotes or brackets 

    ("'[{word▌}]'") 
    ("'[{word}▌]'") 
    ("'[{word}]▌'") 
    ("'[{word}]'▌") 
    ("'[{word}]'"▌) 
    ("'[{word}]'")▌       

You can add or modify 
let g:closingList = ["'",'"',")","]",">","}","$",''] 

in which <C-j> key can pass through. 


If cursor is at last closed bracket pos 
<C-j> key works in following way 

        in python 
            def func(▄) 
            def func(): 
                ▄ 

        in C 
            void func(▄) 
            void func() { 
                ▄ 
            } 

    else works like enter key if the pos of cursor is at last column.
